We can type a number in the Input box.
Example - Enter 10 in the Input Box, then click **Check!**
We get a message displayed on the right.
In this case it says, that our guess was _Too Low!_

Also, we can see that we started with a Score of 20 and now after one failed guess it decreased to 19. So basically after each guess that we fail, the score decreases by one.

Now, let's try 18. And now it's _Too high!_

And now it's correct if we enter the expected number.
So you see that we get this **Correct number!** message on the right.

The screen turns _Green_ and also we now have the **Highscore** here of 17.

A Highscore is another feature of this small application.
Then if you want to play again,we can simply click the **Play Again!** button and it all resets everything except for the Highscore.

So the Highscore is kept and so if I'm quicker in this round, my Highscore will then become better.
